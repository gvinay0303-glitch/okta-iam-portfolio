1. Introduction
This report documents Identity & Access Management (IAM) projects completed between September 2023 and August 2025. The work demonstrates expertise in Okta Workforce Identity, Microsoft Active Directory integration, Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Lifecycle Management, and automation using Okta APIs.
2. Skills Demonstrated
- Okta Workforce Identity & Universal Directory
- Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML/OIDC
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) configuration
- Role-based access and conditional policies
- Security best practices in IAM
3. Project Reports
SSO Setup (SAML/OIDC)
Objective: Configure Okta as Identity Provider (IdP) and enable SAML/OIDC based authentication.
Steps Implemented:
- Configured test application with SAML integration.
- Verified IdP-initiated and SP-initiated login flows.
- Tested session handling and logout flows.
Outcome: Successful login/logout with secure session management.
 
 
 
MFA Configuration
Objective: Enhance authentication with multi-factor security.
Steps Implemented:
- Enabled MFA using Okta Verify, SMS, and Email factors.
- Applied adaptive policies based on risk context.
- Enforced MFA during high-risk logins.
Outcome: Improved security through multiple authentication layers.
 
 
 
 
 
Access Policies
Objective: Implement contextual and role-based access policies.
Steps Implemented:
- Defined conditional access rules based on device and location.
- Applied role-based session policies.
Outcome: Controlled access and reduced unauthorized logins.
App Integration
Objective: Integrate enterprise applications using SAML and OIDC.
Steps Implemented:
- Configured enterprise SaaS apps with Okta as IdP.
- Verified OIDC flows with sample applications.
Outcome: Simplified secure access to enterprise apps.
