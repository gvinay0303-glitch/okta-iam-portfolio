# Okta IAM Portfolio

This repository contains *hands-on Identity & Access Management (IAM) projects* using  
*Okta Workforce Identity* and *Microsoft Entra (Azure AD)*.  

It demonstrates practical implementations of:
- Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML/OIDC
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Lifecycle Management (LCM)
- Access Policies & Role-Based Access
- Active Directory (AD) Integration
- App Integrations & Okta Automation via APIs

---

## ðŸ”‘ Skills Demonstrated
- Okta Workforce Identity & Universal Directory
- SSO (SAML/OIDC) with session handling
- MFA configuration (Okta Verify, SMS, Email factors)
- Role-based access & conditional policies
- Active Directory (AD) integration with Okta
- Automated provisioning & de-provisioning
- Okta API automation workflows
- Security best practices in IAM

   - Automated user creation/deactivation via Okta APIs  
   - Implemented bulk user onboarding scripts  
   - Scheduled automation for identity cleanup
## Okta API Automation

This section demonstrates how I used Okta APIs to automate user management and identity operations.

### Steps Implemented
1. Created an API token in Okta Admin Console.
2. Integrated Okta with Postman using the API token.
3. Configured environment variables for domain, userId, and API key.
4. Executed GET /api/v1/users/{userId} to retrieve user details.
5. Validated token usage and expiry date updates after API execution.

### Proof of Work
All steps are documented with screenshots in /docs/screenshots/okta_api_automation/.

Example result:
> Successfully retrieved user details using Okta API configuredÂ inÂ Postman.
