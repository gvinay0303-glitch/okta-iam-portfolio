# Okta Access Policies Project  

## Objective  
Design and implement *role-based access policies* in Okta to secure resources.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Created user groups: HR, IT Admins, Sales, Finance.  
2. Configured *role-based access control (RBAC)*.  
3. Applied *conditional access rules*:  
   - MFA for external networks.  
   - Session timeout after 15 minutes idle.  
4. Validated policies with test accounts.  

## Outcome  
- Users only access resources based on roles.  
- Stronger governance and compliance.  
- Reduced risk of privilegeÂ misuse.
