# Okta SSO Integration Project  

## Objective  
Configured *Okta Single Sign-On (SSO)* to integrate with Office 365 and Slack for seamless secure access.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Created a new Okta application integration.  
2. Configured SAML 2.0 settings for Office 365.  
3. Mapped attributes (NameID, Email, UPN).  
4. Tested login redirection and token exchange.  

## Outcome  
- Reduced password fatigue by enabling *single login* for multiple apps.  
- Strengthened security with *federated authentication*.
